The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a classical tool in the identification and quantification of local similarities in biological sequences, but we demonstrate that somewhat different issues arise in this different context, and that these factors can be exploited to yield significant speed-up in practice. We include empirical evidence to indicate the utility of the approach and to illustrate the efficiency gains.
